# C9-README-Generator

## Description

This application allows a user to quickly and easily generate a high quality README file by using a command-line application. By using NodeJS and the inquirer npm package we can generate a series of prompts to use for the file saving developers time in the process

## Installation

This project requires NodeJS v16 and the npm inquirer package 8.2.4. Links on how to install them are here:
https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/
https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4

## Usage

The application will be invoked by using the node index.js command in the terminal. Once entered the user will be presented with a series of prompts about the project they are creating. Once the prompts are finished a new README.md file is generated.
